    <div class="intro">Good morning all teachers!
        As we all know, we have gathered to celebrate Teacher's Day online. Let me take this opportunity to thank all our teachers, who have been working very hard to teach us online. Taking education to the next level, this year may have given us tough times, but our teachers have surely been a ray of hope.
        From guiding us to motivating us, this year our respect for teachers worldwide has grown immensely. We know it has been challenging for each one of us, but teachers have been our lockdown mentors. They have supported us throughout and helped us cope with online classes and tests.
        In these tough times, I would like to thank all the teachers on behalf of each and every student for your unwavering support. Thank you for guiding us, inspiring us and making us what we are today!
